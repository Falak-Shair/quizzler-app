# quizzler-app
I am going to be working with a trivia API to create a quiz app called Quizzler. Trivia database, contains over 3000 verified questions which we 
can pick from randomly to fill into our quiz application.The purpose of building this app is to learned about using API endpoints and sending 
requests to a particular end point to ask for some piece of data.
So this is what it's going to look like,

and we're able to keep track of our score and see the true/false question show up in the middle and then we can select true or false. The 
questions that we're answering here come from the open trivia database
